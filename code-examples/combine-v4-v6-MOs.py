"""show how to use the new keys / functionality provided by CoMO

Because MOs are a licensed quantity in SP, it can be helpful to make the best
possible use of the MOs, and with the Combined IPv4/IPv6 Managed Objects
available in SP8.4 MOs that were previously separate to support IPv4 and IPv6
match criteria can now be combined.

Look for IPv6 matches, determine that no functionality is lost, and produce the
JSON for a PATCH to cust02 to move the IPv6 stuff into it. (e.g., if cust02_v6
and cusot02 both exist, can they safely be merged? What would be new MO look
like?) Take a list of MOs that looks like:

     [
         {
             "v4": "cust01_v4",
             "v6": "cust01_v6"
         },
         {
             "v4": "cust02",
             "v6": "cust02_v6"
         },
         {
             "v4": "cust03-4",
             "v6": "cust04"
         },
         {
             "v4": "cust-04",
             "v6": "cust6-04"
         },
         {
             "v4": "cust4-05",
             "v6": "cust6-05"
         }
